# Binary bashlint

Analyze all the requested bash scripts in the specified directories and perform various Linting operations on them. There
are various internal checks performed by bashlint including bash syntax errors, using removed ebash code, ambiguous
return statements, and combined variable declaration and assignment errors.

Additionally, bashlint can utilize the fantastic external tool shellcheck to look for far more difficult to detect
linting errors. By default shellcheck linting is disabled. Yout can opt-in by passing in --shellcheck-severity with a
value of error, warning, info, style.
