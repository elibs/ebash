# Overview

ebash is an open source project developed at [NetApp/SolidFire](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/solidfire) as an open source project from 2011-2018 under the name `bashutils`
and the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). [I](https://github.com/marshall-mcmullen) forked `bashutils` into `ebash` upon my departure from NetApp/SolidFire to continue active
development and ensure it remained free and open source.

The primary goal of ebash is to significantly enhance bash code and make it more *robust*, *feature rich* and *simple* which
greatly accelerates developer productivity.

## Why _bash_

Bash is the ideal language of choice for writing low-level shell scripts and tools requiring direct shell access
invoking simple shell commands on a system for a number of reasons:

* Prolific. Installed on every UNIX machine, minimizing dependencies, install complexity and size.
* Lightweight with low memory and CPU requirements suitable for appliances and embedded systems.
* Ideal for tasks running shell commands as it is native, and simpler than in higher level languages.

## Why _ebash_

Because bash is a lower level language, it lacks some of the features and more advanced data structures typically found
in higher level languages. ebash aims to be _the_ answer to this problem. The most important and compelling feature of
ebash is [implicit error detection](implicit-error-detection.md). This typically results in bash scripts being 75% shorter due to removal of explicit
error handling and the ability to leverage extensive [ebash modules](modules/index).
