# The below aliases allow us to support rich error handling through the use
# of the try/catch idom typically found in higher level languages. Essentially
# the 'try' alias creates a subshell and then turns on implicit error handling
# through "die_on_error" (which essentially just enables 'set -e'). Since this
# runs in a subshell with fatal error handling enabled, the subshell will
# immediately exit on failure. The catch block which immediately follows the
# try block captures the exit status of the subshell and if it's not '0' it
# will invoke the catch block to handle the error.
#
# One clever trick employed here is to keep track of what level of the try/catch
# stack we are in so that the parent's ERR trap won't get triggered and cause
# the process to exit. Because we WANT the try subshell to exit and allow the
# failure to be handled inside the catch block.

# Catch block attached to a preceeding try block. This is a rather complex
# alias and it's probably not readily obvious why it jumps through the hoops
# it is jumping through but trust me they are all important. A few important
# notes about this alias:
#
# (1) Note that the ");" ends the preceeding subshell created by the "try"
#     block. Which means that a try block on it's own will be invalid syntax
#     to try to force try/catch to always be used properly.
#
# (2) All of the "|| true" stuff in this alias is extremely important. Without
#     it the implicit error handling will kick in and the process will be
#     terminated immediately instead of allowing the catch() block to handle
#     the error.
#
# (3) It's often really convenient for the catch block to know what the error
#     code was inside the try block. But that's actually kinda of hard to get
#     right. So here we capture the error code, and then we employ a curious
#     "( exit $rc; ) ||" to create a NEW subshell which exits with the original
#     try block's status. If it was 0 this will do nothing. Otherwise it will
#     call the catch block handling code. If we didn't care about the nesting
#     levels this wouldn't be necessary and we could just simplify the catch
#     alias to "); ||". But knowing the nesting level is really important.
#
# (4) The dangling "||" here requries the caller to put something after the
#     catch block which sufficiently handles the error or the code won't be
#     valid.

causing various test failures where we'd expect an empty string ("") instead of a string with literl
quotes in it ("''").

opt_usage tryrc <<'END'
Tryrc is a convenience wrapper around try/catch that makes it really easy to execute a given command
and capture the command's return code, stdout and stderr into local variables. We created this idiom
because if you handle the failure of a command in any way then bash effectively disables set -e that
command invocation REGARDLESS OF DEPTH. "Handling the failure" includes putting it in a while or
until loop, part of an if/else statement or part of a command executed in a && or ||.

Consider a function call chain such as:

    foo->bar->zap

and you want to get the return value from foo, you might (wrongly) think you could safely use this
and safely bypass set -e explosion:

    foo || rc=$?

The problem is bash effectively disables "set -e" for this command when used in this context. That
means even if zap encounteres an unhandled error die() will NOT get implicitly called (explicit
calls to die would still get called of course).

Here's the insidious documentation from 'man bash' regarding this obscene behavior:

    "The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately
    following a while or until keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of a command
    executed in a && or ||  list  except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a
    pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is being inverted using !."

What's not obvious from that statement is that this applies to the entire expression including any
functions it may call not just the top-level expression that had an error. Ick.

Thus we created tryrc to allow safely capturing the return code, stdout and stderr of a function
call WITHOUT bypassing set -e safety!

This is invoked using the "eval command invocation string" idiom so that it is invoked in the
caller's envionment. For example: $(tryrc some-command)

# Replace normal exit function with our own internal exit function so we can

# invoked even though there was a fatal error causing abnormal termination. We
# can catch this scenario by setting up an EXIT trap and invoking die() if exit
# was invoked outside of our internal exit function.
#
# The other advantage to this approach is that if someone calls exit directly
# inside bash code sourcing ebash in order to gracefully exit they probably
# do NOT want to see a stacktrace and have die() get invoked. This mechanism

die is our central error handling function for all ebash code which is called on any unhandled
error or via the ERR trap. It is responsible for printing a stacktrace to STDERR indicating the
source of the fatal error and then killing our process tree and finally signalling our parent
process that we died via SIGTERM. With this careful setup, we do not need to do any error checking
in our bash scripts. Instead we rely on the ERR trap getting invoked for any unhandled error which
will call die(). At that point we take extra care to ensure that process and all its children exit
with error.

You may call die and tell it what message to print upon death if you'd like to produce a descriptive
error message.

# Variable containing documentation for what we call the "path mapping syntax" idiom. This variable
# can then be used in the docstrings for functions which make use of path mapping syntax without
# having to repeat the documentation (and hence become stale) or refer to another function and be
# less usable.
PATH_MAPPING_SYNTAX_DOC="This function uses the 'path mapping syntax' idiom. Path mapping syntax is a generic idiom used to
map one path to another using a colon to delimit source and destination paths. This is a convenient
idiom often used by functions which need to have a source file and use it in an alternative location
inside the function. For example, '/var/log/kern.log:kern.log' specifies a source file of
'/var/log/kern.log' and a destination file of 'kern.log'.

The path mapping syntax also supports referring to the contents of a directory rather than the
directory itself using scp like syntax. For example, if you wanted to refer to the contents of
/var/log instead of the directory /var/log, you would say '/var/log/.'. The trailing '/.' indicates
the contents of the directory should be used rather than the directory itself. You can also map the
contents of that directory into an alternative destination path using '/var/log/.:logs'."

override_function is a more powerful version of save_function in that it will still save off the

later. If you call override_function multiple times we have to ensure it's idempotent. The danger

etimeout
========

`etimeout` will execute an arbitrary bash command for you, but will only let it
use up the amount of time (i.e. the "timeout") you specify.

If the command tries to take longer than that amount of time, it will be killed
and etimeout will return 124.  Otherwise, etimeout will return the value that
your called command returned.

All arguments to `etimeout` (i.e. everything that isn't an option, or
everything after --) is assumed to be part of the command to execute.
`Etimeout` is careful to retain your quoting.

opt_usage setvars <<'END'
setvars takes a template file with optional variables inside the file which are surrounded on both
sides by two underscores.  It will replace the variable (and surrounding underscores) with a value
you specify in the environment.

For example, if the input file looks like this:
    Hi __NAME__, my name is __OTHERNAME__.

And you call setvars like this
    NAME=Bill OTHERNAME=Ted setvars intputfile

The inputfile will be modified IN PLACE to contain:
    Hi Bill, my name is Ted.

SETVARS_ALLOW_EMPTY=(0|1)
    By default, empty values are NOT allowed. Meaning that if the provided key
    evaluates to an empty string, it will NOT replace the __key__ in the file.
    if you require that functionality, simply use SETVARS_ALLOW_EMPTY=1 and it
    will happily allow you to replace __key__ with an empty string.

    After all variables have been expanded in the provided file, a final check
    is performed to see if all variables were set properly. It will return 0 if
    all variables have been successfully set and 1 otherwise.

SETVARS_WARN=(0|1)
    To aid in debugging this will display a warning on any unset variables.

OPTIONAL CALLBACK:
    You may provided an optional callback as the second parameter to this function.
    The callback will be called with the key and the value it obtained from the

opt_usage quote_eval <<'END'
Ever want to evaluate a bash command that is stored in an array?  It's mostly a great way to do
things.  Keeping the various arguments separate in the array means you don't have to worry about
quoting.  Bash keeps the quoting you gave it in the first place.  So the typical way to run such a
command is like this:

    > cmd=(echo "\$\$")
    > "${cmd[@]}"
    $$

As you can see, since the dollar signs were quoted as the command was put into the array, so the
quoting was retained when the command was executed. If you had instead used eval, you wouldn't get
that behavior:

    > cmd=(echo "\$\$")
    > "${cmd[@]}"

Instead, the argument gets "evaluated" by bash, turning it into the current process id.  So if
you're storing commands in an array, you can see that you typically don't want to use eval.

But there's a wrinkle, of course.  If the first item in your array is the name of an alias, bash
won't expand that alias when using the first syntax. This is because alias expansion happens in a
stage _before_ bash expands the contents of the variable.

So what can you do if you want alias expansion to happen but also want things in the array to be
quoted properly?  Use `quote_array`.  It will ensure that all of the arguments don't get evaluated
by bash, but that the name of the command _does_ go through alias expansion.

    > cmd=(echo "\$\$")
    > quote_eval "${cmd[@]}"
    $$

There, wasn't that simple?
END
quote_eval()
{
    local cmd=("$1")
    shift

    for arg in "${@}" ; do
        cmd+=( "$(printf %q "${arg}")" )
    done

    eval "${cmd[@]}"
}

# STRING MANIPULATION
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

opt_usage to_upper_snake_case <<'END'
Convert a given input string into "upper snake case". This is generally most useful when converting
a "CamelCase" string although it will work just as well on non-camel case input. Essentially it
looks for all upper case letters and puts an underscore before it, then uppercase the entire input
string.

For example:

    sliceDriveSize => SLICE_DRIVE_SIZE
    slicedrivesize => SLICEDRIVESIZE

It has some special handling for some common corner cases where the normal camel case idiom isn't
well followed. The best example for this is around units (e.g. MB, GB). Consider "sliceDriveSizeGB"
where SLICE_DRIVE_SIZE_GB is preferable to SLICE_DRIVE_SIZE_G_B.

The current list of translation corner cases this handles: KB, MB, GB, TB

Convert a given input string into "lower snake case". This is generally most useful when converting
a "CamelCase" string although it will work just as well on non-camel case input. Essentially it
looks for all upper case letters and puts an underscore before it, then lowercase the entire input

opt_usage string_truncate <<'END'
Truncate a specified string to fit within the specified number of characters. If the ellipsis option
is specified, truncation will result in an ellipses where the removed characters were (and the total
string will still fit within length characters)

Any arguments after the length will be considered part of the text to string_truncate

opt_usage string_getline <<'END'
Helper function to make it easy to grab a specific line from a provided string. This is done using sed with '${num}q;d'.
What this does is advance to the requested line number, deleting everything it has seen in the buffer prior to the
current line, then then quits. This is significantly faster than the typical head | tail approach. The requested line
number must be > 0 or an error will be returned. Since we don't expect the caller to check the number of lines in the
input string before calling this function, this function will return an empty string if a line number is requested
beyond the length of the privided string.
END

    $(opt_parse \
        "?input | Input string to parse for the requested line number." \

    echo "${input}" | sed "${num}q;d"
}

opt_usage is_int <<'END'
Returns true if the input string is an integer and false otherwise. May have a leading '-' or '+'
to indicate the number is negative or positive. This does NOT handle floating point numbers. For
that you should instead use is_num.
END
is_int()
{
    [[ "${1}" =~ ^[-+]?[0-9]+$ ]] && return 0 || return 1
}

opt_usage is_num <<'END'
Returns true if the input string is a number and false otherwise. May have a leading '-' or '+'
to indicate the number is negative or positive. Unlike is_integer, this function properly handles
floating point numbers.

is_num at present does not handle fractions or exponents or numbers is other bases (e.g. hex).
But in the future we may add support for these as needed. As such we decided not to limit ourselves
with calling this just is_float.
