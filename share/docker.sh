opt_usage docker_build <<'END'
docker_build is used to intelligently build a docker image from a Dockerfile using an external cache docker registry/repo
which may be the same or different from the production registry/repo. For example, we typically have a dedicated
registry/repo for CI/CD images which are treated only as a cache and can be prunned or blown away entirely as needed. We
have a separate registry/repo for our official released builds which we want to keep uncluttered.

The main functionality added by docker_build is to avoid building redudant, identical docker images. The most common use
case here is lots of git branches all trying to build and tag docker images which are essentially identical. Even with
docker's built-in layer caching mechanism, "docker build" always hits the cache and does a new build even on 100% cache
hits. Granted the build will be _fast_, but it's still unecessary if we've already built it with identical content but a
different tag. Moreover, vanilla "docker build" command is not distributed. Every developer is forced to do a build even
if another developer has already built and published. Ebash's "docker_build" addresses this problem using the cach repo.

The algorithm we employ is as follows:

    1) Look for the image locally
    2) Try to download the underlying content-based SHA image from docker cache repository
    3) Build the docker image from scratch

This entire algorithm is built on a simple idea of essentially computing our own simplistic sha256 dependency SHA which
captures the content of the provided Dockerfile as well as any files which are dynamically copied or added via COPY/ADD
directives in the Dockerfile as well as any build arguements. We then simply use that dynamically generated content
based tag to easily be able to look for the image in the cache repository. For more details see docker_depends_sha.

Overlay Modules
===============

docker_build supports the concept of overlay modules which facilitates copying files into the resulting docker image
that we build. The purpose of this is to provide dockerized versions of things that would otherwise not work properly
inside docker. The best example of this is systemd. Systemd binaries, such as systemctl and journalctl, do not function
properly inside docker because there is no init daemon inside docker containers. To solve this problem, ebash provides a
set of replacements for systemd binaries that simulate their intended functionality. These are generally NOT fully
functional replacements but simple, stripped down replacements that get the job done.

The overlay files are automatically accounted for with the built-in dependency SHA and caching mechanism used by
docker_build.

There are several built-in overlay modules provided by ebash that you can enable via --overlay=<module>. This is an
accumulator so you can pass it in multiple times to enable multiple overlay modules.

    1) systemd

       This provides several critical binary replacements to provide seamless systemd-like functionality:

         a) /usr/local/bin/systemctl: manage multiple ebash controlled daemons. This supports 'start', 'stop', 'status',
            'restart' actions on each daemon.
         b) /usr/local/bin/timedatectl: simulate systemd timedatectl functionality. This supports being called with no
            arguments and it will output something similar to the real timedatectl. It also supports being called with
            "set-timezone ZONE".
         c) /usr/local/bin/journalctl: This does not implement the full journalctl functionality but instead acts as a
            lightweight wrapper around rsyslog logger. By default if you call this with no arguments it will simply cat
            /var/log/messages and pass them into your pager. If you pass in -f or --follow it will tail the log file.

    2) rsyslog

       This is *NOT* a full replacement for rsyslog. Instead it simply provides a custom /etc/rsylog.conf file which
       allows rsyslog to function properly inside docker. You also need to __install__ rsyslog in your container and
       must also start it up as a daemon (probably using ebash controlled init script).

    3) selinux

       This is *NOT* a full replacement for selinux. Instead it simply provides a custom /etc/selinux/config file which
       completely disables selinux entirely as it doesn't work inside docker.

Finally, you can install your own custom overlay files via --overlay-tree=<path>. The entire tree of the provided path
will be copied into the root of the created container. For example, if you had "overlay/usr/local/bin/foo" and you
called "docker_build --overlay-tree overlay" then inside the container you will have "/usr/local/bin/foo".

Notes
=====
(1) If you want to push any tags you need to provide --username and --password arguments or have DOCKER_USERNAME and
DOCKER_PASSWORD environment variables set.
