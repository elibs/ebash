destination path is still mounted.

opt_usage ebindmount <<'END'
Bind mount $1 over the top of $2.  Ebindmount works to ensure that all of your mounts are private so that we don't see
different behavior between systemd machines (where shared mounts are the default) and everywhere else (where private
mounts are the default). This is not an issue if we are already running inside docker's namespace protection mechanisms.
So this function is essentially a passthrough into "emount --rbind" if we are running inside docker.

Source and destination MUST be the first two parameters of this function. You may specify any other mount options after
them.

    # In order to avoid polluting other mount points that we recursively bind, we want to make sure that our mount

    # with another's mounts.
    #
    # We must make sure the source mount is private first, because otherwise when we bind mount our location into our
    # mount namespace, it will start off as shared.  And the shared version will be seen across _other_ mount
    # namespaces.  Sure, we can subsequently mark it private in our own, but that action won't actually affect the

opt_usage ebindmount_into <<END
Bind mount a list of paths into the specified directory. This function will iterate over all the source paths provided
and bind mount each source path into the provided destination directory. This function will merge the contents all into
the final destination path much like cp or rsync would but without the overhead of actually copying the files. To fully
cleanup the destination directory created by ebindmount_into you should use eunmount --all --recursive.

If there are files with the same name already in the destination directory the new version will be shadow mounted over
the existing version. This has the effect of merging the contents but allowing updated files to effectively replace what
is already in the directory. This property holds true for files as well as directories. Consider the following example:

# echo "src1" >src1/file1
# echo "src2" >src2/file1
# ebindmount_into dest src1/. src2/.
# cat dest/file1
# src2

Notce that since 'file1' existed in both src1 and src2 and we bindmount src2 after src1, we will see the contents of
src2/file1 inside dest/file1 instead of src1/file1. The last one wins.

This example is true of directories as well with the important caveat that the directory's contents are still MERGED but
files shadow over one another. Consider the following example:

# echo "src1" >src1/foo/file0
# echo "src1" >src1/foo/file1
# echo "src2" >src2/foo/file1
# ebindmount_into dest src1/. src2/.
# cat dest/foo/file1
# src2
# ls dest
# foo/file0 foo/file1

Again, notice that since 'file1' existed in both src1/foo and src2/foo and we bindmount src2 after src1, we see 'src2'
in the file instead of 'src1'. Also, notice that the bindmount of the directory src2/foo did not hide the contents of
the existing src1/foo directory that we already bind mounted into dest.
