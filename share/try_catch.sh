# The below aliases allow us to support rich error handling through the use of the try/catch idom typically found in
# higher level languages. Essentially the 'try' alias creates a subshell and then turns on implicit error handling
# through "die_on_error" (which essentially just enables 'set -e'). Since this runs in a subshell with fatal error
# handling enabled, the subshell will immediately exit on failure. The catch block which immediately follows the try
# block captures the exit status of the subshell and if it's not '0' it will invoke the catch block to handle the error.
#
# One clever trick employed here is to keep track of what level of the try/catch stack we are in so that the parent's
# ERR trap won't get triggered and cause the process to exit. Because we WANT the try subshell to exit and allow the
# failure to be handled inside the catch block.

# Catch block attached to a preceeding try block. This is a rather complex alias and it's probably not readily obvious
# why it jumps through the hoops it is jumping through but trust me they are all important. A few important notes about
# this alias:
#
# 1) Note that the ");" ends the preceeding subshell created by the "try" block. Which means that a try block on it's
#    own will be invalid syntax to try to force try/catch to always be used properly.
#
# 2) All of the "|| true" stuff in this alias is extremely important. Without it the implicit error handling will kick
#    in and the process will be terminated immediately instead of allowing the catch() block to handle the error.
#
# 3) It's often really convenient for the catch block to know what the error code was inside the try block. But that's
#    actually kinda of hard to get right. So here we capture the error code, and then we employ a curious "( exit $rc; )
#    ||" to create a NEW subshell which exits with the original try block's status. If it was 0 this will do nothing.
#    Otherwise it will call the catch block handling code. If we didn't care about the nesting
#     levels this wouldn't be necessary and we could just simplify the catch alias to "); ||". But knowing the nesting
#     level is really important.
#
# 4) The dangling "||" here requries the caller to put something after the catch block which sufficiently handles the
#    error or the code won't be valid.

'exit'.

opt_usage tryrc <<'END'
Tryrc is a convenience wrapper around try/catch that makes it really easy to execute a given command and capture the
command's return code, stdout and stderr into local variables. We created this idiom because if you handle the failure
of a command in any way then bash effectively disables set -e that command invocation REGARDLESS OF DEPTH. "Handling the
failure" includes putting it in a while or until loop, part of an if/else statement or part of a command executed in a
&& or ||.

Consider a function call chain such as:

    foo->bar->zap

and you want to get the return value from foo, you might (wrongly) think you could safely use this and safely bypass set
-e explosion:

    foo || rc=$?

The problem is bash effectively disables "set -e" for this command when used in this context. That means even if zap
encounteres an unhandled error die() will NOT get implicitly called (explicit calls to die would still get called of
course).

Here's the insidious documentation from 'man bash' regarding this obscene behavior:

    "The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a while or
    until keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of a command executed in a && or ||  list  except the
    command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is
    being inverted using !."

What's not obvious from that statement is that this applies to the entire expression including any functions it may call
not just the top-level expression that had an error. Ick.

Thus we created tryrc to allow safely capturing the return code, stdout and stderr of a function call WITHOUT bypassing
set -e safety!

This is invoked using the "eval command invocation string" idiom so that it is invoked in the caller's envionment. For
example: $(tryrc some-command)

be notified via sigterm.
