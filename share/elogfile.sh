opt_usage elogfile <<'END'
elogfile provides the ability to duplicate the calling processes STDOUT and STDERR and send them both to a list of files
while simultaneously displaying them to the console. Using this function is much preferred over manually doing this with
tee and named pipe redirection as we take special care to ensure STDOUT and STDERR pipes are kept separate to avoid
problems with logfiles getting truncated.
