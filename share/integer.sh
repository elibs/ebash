opt_usage increment <<'END'
increment is a convenience wrapper around the bash "+=" and "++" operators to avoid triggering "set -e" failures and
make it easier to do such a simple task in ebash. This fundamental problem this solves is when incrementing a bash
integer, bash returns a non-zero return code from the "++" which ebash detects and triggers die(). The reason that bash
does this is because it returns the incremented value which generally is non-zero and thus an error.

The other idiom we frequently use is "(( i += 1 ))". This idiom also has problems though when the value gets incremented
to zero or decremented to zero. This gets confusingly reported as an error by bash which ebash will then detect and abort
on. The safest idiom to use , which works in every scenario, is as follows:

    i=$(( i -= 1 ))

However, that's pretty ugly syntax and easy to mess up. So the ebash solution is to simply call the "increment"
function:

    increment i

The other useful feature of increment is that you can pass in an optional amount to increment by, which defaults to 1:

    increment i 100

END
increment()
{
    $(opt_parse \
        "__variable  | Variable to increment" \
        "?__amount=1 | The amount to increment the variable by.")

    eval "${__variable}=$(( __variable += __amount ))"
}

opt_usage decrement <<'END'
decrement is a convenience wrapper around the bash "-=" and "--" operators to avoid triggering "set -e" failures and
make it easier to do such a simple task in ebash. This fundamental problem this solves is when decrementing a bash
integer, bash returns a non-zero return code from the "--" which ebash detects and triggers die(). The reason that bash
does this is because it returns the decremented value which generally is non-zero and thus an error.

{

        "?__amount=1 | The amount to decrement the variable by.")

    eval "${__variable}=$(( __variable -= __amount ))"
}
