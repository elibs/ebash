opt_usage module_conf <<'END'
The conf module operates on INI configuration files. These are supported by many different tools and languages.
Sometimes the rules vary a little. This implementation is based on [wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)
description of the INI format.

These typically look something like the following:

```INI
[section]
property=value

[another_section]
property=different value
another_property=value
```

Where a sequence of "properties" are stored in sections. There may be properties of the same name in different sections
with different values. In this implementation, values that are not in a named section will be placed in a section named
"default"

You may specify multiple configuration files, in which case files that are *later* in the list will override the
settings from configuration files specified earlier in the list. In other words, if you call `conf_read` like this,
settings from `~/.config/A` will override those in `/etc/A` and all results will be stored in `CONF`

```bash
declare -A CONF
conf_read CONF /etc/A ~/.config/A
```

Here the the details of the INI specification from wikipedia's description that ebash implements:

### Comments

- Both ; and # at the beginning of a line start a comment.
- You can't create comments at the end of a line. Instead, whatever is on the line past the equal sign will become part
  of the property created on that line

### Sections

- Section names may not contain whitespace, nor may they contain equal signs or periods.
- Section names are case sensitive.
- No section is required, properties without a section declaration are placed in "default"

### Properties

- Property names may not contain whitespace, nor may they contain equal signs
- Property names are case sensitive.
- Whitespace around the name is ignored.
- Values cannot contain newlines. Whitespace is stripped from the ends, but retained within the value
- Values can be surrounded by single or double quotes, in which case there must only be two of that particular quote
  character on the line. No escaping is allowed.
- When quoted, all whitespace in the value within the quotes is retained. This doesn't change that values cannot contain
  newlines.

opt_usage conf_read <<END

the associative array will be named for the sections of your INI file, and the entry will be a pack containing all
configuration values from inside that section.

conf_to_json converts the named configuration to an anonymous JSON object. Each named section in the configratuion will
be a top-level named JSON object. Each property inside that section will then be a series of '"key": "value"' pairs in
the JSON. By defualt, all the properties are displayed as quoted strings. But this can be controlled via --props-int to
not quote the values as they are known to be integers. Alternatively the properties can be automatically split on
whitespace and printed as a JSON array.
