opt_usage daemon_init <<'END'
daemon_init is used to initialize the options pack that all of the various daemon_* functions will use. This makes it
easy to specify global settings for all of these daemon functions without having to worry about consistent argument
parsing and argument conflicts between the various daemon_* functions. All of the values set into this pack are
available in the caller's various hooks if desired. If a chroot is provided it is only used inside the body that calls
${cmdline}. If you need to be in the chroot to execute a given hook you're responsible for doing that yourself.

The following are the keys used to control daemon functionality:

bindmounts
  Optional whitespace separated list of additional paths which whould be bind mounted into the chroot by the daemon
  process during daemon_start. A trap will be setup so that the bind mounts are automatically unmounted when the process
  exits. The syntax for these bind mounts allow mounting them into alternative paths inside the chroot using a colon to
  delimit the source path outside the chroot and the desired mount point inside the chroot. (e.g.
  /var/log/kern.log:/var/log/host_kern.log)

cgroup
  Optional cgroup to run the daemon in. If the cgroup does not exist it will be created for you. The daemon assumes
  ownership of ALL processes in that cgroup and will kill them at shutdown time. (So give it its own cgroup). See
  cgroups.sh for more information.

chroot
  Optional CHROOT to run the daemon in. chroot_cmd will be used to execute the provided command line but all other hooks
  will be performed outside of the chroot. Though the CHROOT variable will be availble in the hooks if needed.

cmdline
  The command line to be run as a daemon. This includes the executable as well as any of its arguments.

delay
  The delay to wait, in sleep(1) syntax, before attempting to restart the daemon when it exits. This should never be <1s
  otherwise race conditions in startup and shutdown are possible. Defaults to 1s.

logfile
  Optional logfile to send all stdout and stderr to for the daemon. Since it generally doesn't make sense for the
  stdout/stderr of the daemon to spew into the caller's stdout/stderr, these will default to /dev/null if not otherwise
  specified.

logfile_count
  Maximum number of logfiles to keep (defaults to 5). See elogfile and elogrotate for more details.

logfile_size
  Maximum logfile size before logfiles should be rotated. This defaults to zero such that if you provide any logfile it
  will be rotated automatially. See elogfile and elogrotate for more details.

name
  The name of the daemon, for readability purposes. By default this will use the basename of the command being executed.

pidfile
  Path to the pidfile for the daemon. By default this is the basename of the command being executed, stored in /var/run.

pre_start
  Optional hook to be executed before starting the daemon. Must be a single command to be executed.  If more complexity
  is required use a function. If this hook fails, the daemon will NOT be started or respawned.

pre_stop
  Optional hook to be executed before stopping the daemon. Must be a single command to be executed.  If more complexity
  is required use a function. Any errors from this hook are ignored.

post_mount
  Optional hook to be executed after bind mounts have been created but before starting the daemon.  Must be a single
  command to be executed. If more complexity is required use a function. This hook is invoked regardless of whether this
  daemon has bind mounts. Any errors from this hook are ignored

post_stop
  Optional hook to be exected after stopping the daemon. Must be a single command to be executed. If more complexity is
  required use a function. Any errors from this hook are ignored.

post_crash
  Optional hook to be executed after the daemon stops abnormally (i.e not through daemon_stop).  Errors from this hook
  are ignored.

post_abort
  Optional hook to be called after the daemon aborts due to crashing too many times. Errors from this hook are ignored.

respawns
  The maximum number of times to respawn the daemon command before just giving up. Defaults to 10.

respawn_interval
  Amount of seconds the process must stay up for it to be considered a successful start. This is used in conjunction
  with respawn similar to upstart/systemd. If the process is respawned more than ${respawns} times within
  ${respawn_interval} seconds, the process will no longer be respawned.

netns_name
  Network namespce to run the daemon in.  The namespace must be created and properly configured before use.  if you use
  this, you need to source netns.sh from ebash prior to calling daemon_start

daemon_start will daemonize the provided command and its arguments as a pseudo-daemon and automatically respawn it on
failure. We don't use the core operating system's default daemon system, as that is platform dependent and lacks the
portability we need to daemonize things on any arbitrary system.
