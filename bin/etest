opt_usage main <<'END'
etest is an extensible test framework primarily focused at providing a rich test framework for bash complete with test
suites and a rich set of test assertions and other various test related frameworks. It also supports running any
standalone executable binaries or scripts written in any language. In this mode it is essentially a simple test driver.

Tests can be grouped into test suites by placing them into a *.etest file. Each test is then a function inside that file
with the naming scheme `ETEST_${suite}_${testcase}` (e.g. `ETEST_array_init` for the `array` suite and the testcase
`init`). Each test suite *.etest file can contain optional `sutie_setup` and `suite_teardown` functions which are
performed only once at the start and end of a suite, respectively. It can also optionally contain `setup` and
`teardown` functions which are run before and after every single individual test.

etest provides several additional security and auditing features of interest:

    1) Every test is run in its own subshell to ensure process isolation.
    2) Every test is run inside a unique cgroup (on Linux) to further isolate the process, mounts and networking from
       the rest of the system.
    3) Each test is monitored for process leaks and mount leaks.

Tests can be repeated, filtered, excluded, debugged, traced and a host of other extensive developer friendly features.

etest produces a JUnit/XUnit compatible etest.xml file at the end of the test run listing all the tests that were
executed along with runtimes and specific lists of passing, failing and flaky tests. This file can be directly hooked
into Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and BitBucket Pipelines for clear test visibility and reporting.
